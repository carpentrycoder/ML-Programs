# Machine Learning Experimentation with Real-World Scenarios

I have completed 10 Machine Learning codes to explore various algorithms and their real-world applications. This series helped me understand key concepts crucial for my semester and is a valuable resource for anyone looking to dive into the field of Machine Learning.

## Completed Experiments

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machines**
4. **Hebbian Learning**
5. **Expectation-Maximization Algorithm**
6. **McCulloch-Pitts Model**
7. **Single Layer Perceptron Learning Algorithm**
8. **Error Backpropagation Perceptron Training Algorithm**

These algorithms were implemented in Python and applied to various real-world datasets to help solidify my understanding of their functionality and use cases.
